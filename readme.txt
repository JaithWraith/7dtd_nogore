JaithWraith's 7DTD No Gore Mod - V1.7.2 (Alpha 19.2 Release)
Author: JaithWraith

OVERVIEW:
This is a simple mod that tones down the gore in 7 Days to Die. If this mod isn't to your tastes, that's fine - don't use it. :) While the game still deals with mature situations and will have decaying zombies and such, this mod removes the splattering blood and dramatically reduces decapitations. Additionally, it changes the Zombie Stripper to put some clothes on...

COMPATABILITY:
Since this mod relies on customized entityclasses.xml and progression.xml files, it is not compatible with any mod that also modifies these files. With decapitations tied to perks in A18, I had to edit the effect of skills involved in decapitation. Keep in mind that it is now almost pointless to take the headshot skill and deep cuts will not grant a decapitation chance. I haven't been able to fully test these as it requires a longer playthrough, so please let me know if you encounter any problems. Of course, you could always just avoid taking skills that add decap chance. :)

I'm new to making my mods available to others so if you have tips on how else I might approach the task of modding 7DTD in a manner more compatible with other mods, I'm open to suggestions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Always begin by making a backup of your entityclasses.xml and progression.xml files! 

Once the mod is extracted, copy the modified entityclasses.xml and progression.xml into the steamapps > common > 7 Days to Die > Data > Config folder and replace the existing files.

v1.7.2 is compatible with the Alpha 19.2 release.
