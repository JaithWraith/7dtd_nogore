JaithWraith's 7DTD No Gore Mod - V1.0.0
Author: JaithWraith

For additional information, you can find this project at www.github.com/JaithWraith/7dtd_nogore.

OVERVIEW:
This is a simple mod that tones down the gore in 7 Days to Die. If this mod isn't to your tastes, that's fine - don't use it. :)
While the game still deals with mature situations and will have decaying zombies and such, this mod removes the splattering blood
and dramatically reduces decapitations. 

COMPATABILITY:
Since this mod relies on a customized entityclasses.xml file, it is not compatible with any mod that also modifies entityclasses.
I'm new to making my mods available to others so if you have tips on how else I might approach the task of modding 7DTD in a more
modular manner, I'm open to suggestions.

As of V1.0.0 this mod is compatible with the Alpha 0.16 release.
