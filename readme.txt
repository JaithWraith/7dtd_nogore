JaithWraith's 7DTD No Gore Mod - V1.8.3 (Alpha 20.6 Release)
Author: JaithWraith

OVERVIEW:
This is a simple mod that tones down the gore in 7 Days to Die. If this mod isn't to your tastes, that's fine - don't use it. :) While the game still deals with mature situations and will have decaying zombies and such, this mod removes the splattering blood and dramatically reduces decapitations. Additionally, it changes the Zombie Party Girl to put some more clothes on...

COMPATABILITY:
Since this mod relies on customized entityclasses.xml, item_modifiers.xml, items.xml, and progression.xml files, it is not compatible with any mod that also modifies these files. With the new dismemberment system in A20 I had to edit the effect of skills and weapons with a decapitation chance as well as item modifiers and buff effects. These changes have worked very well at ending dismemberment in my testing, but please let me know if you encounter any problems. Keep in mind that it is now almost pointless to take the headshot skill and deep cuts will not grant a dismember chance. 

INSTRUCTIONS:
Always begin by making a backup of your entityclasses.xml, item_modifiers.xml, items.xml, and progression.xml files! 

Once the mod is extracted, copy the modified buffs.xml, entityclasses.xml, item_modifiers.xml, items.xml, and progression.xml into the steamapps > common > 7 Days to Die > Data > Config folder and replace the existing files.

v1.8.2 is compatible with the Alpha 20.4 release.
