JaithWraith's 7DTD No Gore Mod - V1.3.0
Author: JaithWraith

For additional information, you can find this project at www.github.com/JaithWraith/7dtd_nogore.

OVERVIEW:
This is a simple mod that tones down the gore in 7 Days to Die. If this mod isn't to your tastes, that's fine - don't use it. :) While the game still deals with mature situations and will have decaying zombies and such, this mod removes the splattering blood and dramatically reduces decapitations. Additionally, it changes the Zombie Stripper to put some clothes on...

COMPATABILITY:
Since this mod relies on customized entityclasses.xml and progression.xml files, it is not compatible with any mod that also modifies entityclasses or progression. With decapitations tied to perks in A17, I had to edit the effect of all skills involved in decapitation. Keep in mind that it is now essentially pointless to take the headshot skill. I'm new to making my mods available to others so if you have tips on how else I might approach the task of modding 7DTD in a more modular manner, I'm open to suggestions.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Always begin by making a backup of your entityclasses.xml and progression.xml files! 

Once the mod is extracted, copy the modified entityclasses.xml and progression.xml into the steamapps > common > 7 Days to Die > Data > Config folder and replace the existing file.

v1.3.0 is compatible with the Alpha 0.17 release.
